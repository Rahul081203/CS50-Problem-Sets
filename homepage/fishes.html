            Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits.<br>
            Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.<br>
            Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.<br>

            The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period.<br>
            Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts.<br>
            Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms.<br>
            Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators.<br>
            The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.<br>
